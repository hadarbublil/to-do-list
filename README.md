## *Implementation Details*

### *Database:*
- Tasks are stored as individual files, with the task ID used as the filename.
- This structure allows for fast searching by ID.

### *Data Loading:*
- When the backend state is updated, the frontend reloads all tasks. 
- Although this approach may have performance implications, it ensures consistency between the backend and frontend, making it easier to maintain.
